# PostgreSQL Logical Replication

PostgreSQL https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/replication.html[Logical Replication] allows changes
from a database to be streamed in real-time to an external systems. It provides an
https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html[Event Sourcing] pattern for PostgreSQL.

Logical decoding reads the databaseâ€™s write-ahead log (WAL), and emits row-level change events on row `insert`, `update`
and `delete`. Those events are `grouped by transaction`,
and appear `in the order` in which they were committed to the database. Aborted/rolled-back transactions do not appear in
the stream.
